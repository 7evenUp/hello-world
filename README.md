# hello-world
It's my first work
I'm 16 years old and I'm sure I can speak fluently English as I've taken a lot of English lessons in my school.
If there are some grammar mistakes, please don't flame me as I'm just a child ;-)
U can call me Tema, but my full name(as it considered to say in Russia) is Artyom.
